<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-absorbable Surgical Mesh</li><li>Absorbable Surgical Mesh</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical mesh market is categorized into three main types: non-absorbable surgical mesh, absorbable surgical mesh, and others. Non-absorbable surgical mesh remains permanently in the body, typically used for hernia repairs and pelvic surgeries due to its durability. Absorbable surgical mesh gradually breaks down and is replaced by natural tissue, ideal for temporary support in procedures where permanent mesh is unnecessary. "Others" encompass various specialty meshes, including composite materials and reinforced types designed for specific surgical applications.</p></p>
